# Overview

This repository provides guidelines for new research assistants and research managers working with professors.
It covers the administrative aspects of the role. Coding, programming, and data analysis aspects are covered in my 
[R Guide](https://github.com/skhiggins/R_guide) and 
[Python Guide](https://github.com/skhiggins/Python_guide).

To be successful in this role, a key thing to understand is that **professors are super busy**. 
We are dividing our time between 
- Teaching (preparing, teaching, meeting with students, grading)
- Traveling the country and world to present our research at universities and conferences (or presenting on Zoom during COVID times)
- Traveling to other countries to access data, manage existing projects, and develop new projects
- Meeting with potential data providers, funders, and implementing partners
- Meeting with coauthors 
- Attending the seminars and research lunches our departments host and meeting with visiting speakers
- Doing service for the department
- Applying for grants
- Managing the administration of existing grants
- Advising PhD students
- Recruiting new faculty, PhD students, and RAs
- Reading research papers 
- Refereeing papers for journals
- Serving as discussant of papers at conferences
- Reviewing papers submitted to conferences and serving on conference program committees
- Reviewing and scoring grant proposals
- Brainstorming research projects
- Analyzing data
- Writing and revising papers
 
# What this means for you as a research assistant/research manager
- When you send emails, **highlight the important things for me to read in bold**.
- If there is an important email I have not responded to, don't just let it sit for more than a week -- send it again (and again and again).
- If there is something you know I need to do for the project (e.g., send questions to a partner organization), remind me repeatedly by email and in the weekly call. Include this pending item in the agenda for the weekly call.
- Never assume I've taken action based on an email you sent until I confirm taking action. If there are things that I tell you are top priority or time sensitive, once you send them to me continue to follow up and put this item at the top of the weekly call agenda to ensure that after receiving it from you I've taken the necessary action (e.g. submit it; forward it; etc.)
- If it's not on my calendar, it does not exist. Ensure all project calls are on my calendar, with a zoom link if applicable and with the invitation to everyone who needs to be on the call. These calendar invites should be sent as early as possible to ensure that I know about these events on my calendar when scheduling other calls. (Note that I am not the only one who looks at my calendar to schedule calls, so me knowing about the call is not enough -- it has to be on my calendar.)
- Whenever you attach a file to an email, that file must also be saved in our shared GitHub/Dropbox/Box, and you should write out the path to where the file is saved in the body of the email.

# Organization
- Before our weekly calls, send an agenda.
- After our weekly calls, send a call recap with to-do items.
- Send a weekly email that includes your timesheet, bullet points of the main things you did during the past week, and bullet points of your priorities for the next week.
